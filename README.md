# What is this about?

I was bored, so I decided to learn something new today: Telegram API. In fact, I was wondering if I could get back to a channel I've 
deleted recently but I couldn't remember its name (nice).

# How to and stuff

Well known commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Enjoy!
